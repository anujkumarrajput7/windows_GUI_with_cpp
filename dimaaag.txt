ball function ko input my xy coordinate dena hai sirf ,
motion karana hai either kyboard input se ya fir function input jo ki physics engine dega ,
tumko is file me physics engine nahi lagana hai.


>>TASK1

create new file that takes in input from the user and move the ball to the given coordinate,
make sure the refresh rate is 60hz.

>>TASK2 for future refrence

 add diagonal movement and increase the speed.
 also make OperatableBall.cpp a function operated and call the functionin main 
 the parameters are speed in (pixel/sec) and intial position of the ball in x and y coordinate
aand the default position is in the middle of the window.
