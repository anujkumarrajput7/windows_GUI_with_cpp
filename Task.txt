ball function ko input my xy coordinate dena hai sirf ,
motion karana hai either kyboard input se ya fir function input jo ki physics engine dega ,
tumko is file me physics engine nahi lagana hai.


>>TASK1

create new file that takes in input from the user and move the ball to the given coordinate,          DONE
make sure the refresh rate is 60hz.

>>TASK2 for future refrence

 add diagonal movement and increase the speed.                                                        DONE
 also make OperatableBall.cpp a function operated and call the functionin main 
 the parameters are speed in (pixel/sec) and intial position of the ball in x and y coordinate 
 upperbound x lowerbound = 1080 x 2160.
 and the default position is in the middle of the window.
 
 new file directory structure.   
    Ball.h -> header definition for the ball.cpp
    Ball.cpp -> I has necessary functions to set the ball's size , color;
    OperatableObject.h -> If needed 
    OperatableObject.cpp -> controls the movement of object with overloaded functions, the
                            input can be given through keyboard or input x and y coordinates int the function.
    keyboardinput.cpp -> This files takes in the input from the keyboard and gives the coordinates to move the ball.
